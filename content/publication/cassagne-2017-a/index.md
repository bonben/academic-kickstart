abstract = "This demonstration intends to present AFF3CT (A Fast Forward 3rror Correction Tool). The main objective of AFF3CT is to provide a portable, open source, fast and flexible software to the channel coding community in such a way that researchers can spend more time on channel coding / algorithmic problems instead of software development issues. It is also intended to facilitate the process of hardware verification and debug with the objective of fast prototyping."
