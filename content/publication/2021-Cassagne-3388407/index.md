abstract = "Software implementation of digital communication systems is more and more used in different contexts. In the case of satellite communication standards, they are an appealing alternative in ground stations. The challenge is to push the performance of these digital communication systems to meet the real time constraints. In this paper, we propose an open source digital communication transceiver that enables to exploit the parallelism of general purpose processors (multicore, SIMD). It is also flexible, supporting several modulation and coding schemes. Finally, it is portable, being able to adapt to the level of parallelism of different CPU architectures (x86 and ARM)."
