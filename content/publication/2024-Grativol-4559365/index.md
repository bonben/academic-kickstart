abstract = "This paper tackles the challenges of implementing few-shot learning on embedded systems, specifically FPGA SoCs, a vital approach for adapting to diverse classification tasks, especially when the costs of data acquisition or labeling prove to be prohibitively high. Our contributions encompass the development of an end-to-end open-source pipeline for a few-shot learning platform for object classification on a FPGA SoCs. The pipeline is built on top of the Tensil open-source framework, facilitating the design, training, evaluation, and deployment of DNN backbones tailored for few-shot learning. Additionally, we showcase our work’s potential by building and deploying a low-power, low-latency demonstrator trained on the MiniImageNet dataset with a dataflow architecture. The proposed system has a latency of 30 ms while consuming 6.2 W on the PYNQ-Z1 board."
