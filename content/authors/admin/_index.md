I conduct research at the IMT Atlantique in Brest on hardware and software implementations of signal processing and AI algorithms. I teach computer engineering and digital electronics.

My PhD thesis focused on the implementation of polar codes decoders. I proposed the fastest software implementation of the Adaptive SC List decoding algorithm to date. This implementation is integrated in the [AFF3CT](https://aff3ct.github.io) toolbox to which I actively contribute. I'm also part of the organisation committee of the next [ISTC 2023](https://istc2023.org) conference.

I currently focus on efficient hardware and software implementations of Neural Networks, aiming at low latency and energy efficiency, through multiple industrial collaborations, and in the near future as the coordinator of a JCJC ANR project, [ProPruNN](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr/recherche-innovation/collaborer/projet/proprunn).
